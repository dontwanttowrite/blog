# Blog #0 - The Beginning

I don't want to write this post. I don't want to write on this blog. In fact, I hated writing as a student, from middle school all the way to college. (I still hate writing, but I used to, too.) I can remember procrastinating until the very last minute for most writing assignments, expending more energy in stress and mental anguish than if I had not avoided the inevitable. 

I'm not writing this for you. I'm writing this for me, and because I have to. This is a way to confront that which I loathe; to conquer an important part of what is limiting me personally, professionally, and spiritually. Writing is a process of distilling these random thoughts, words, associations, and feelings in my brain into complete, real, and (hopefully) beautiful sentences, paragraphs, essays, and ideas. To be on the success curve in life requires doing what you sometimes don't want to do. I intend to be on that success curve.

So here is my line in the sand. Here is my first post, the beginning of my journey to improving my writing and concentration abilities. Sayonara!
